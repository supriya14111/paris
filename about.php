                        Paris has a long and storied history with the Olympic Games, having hosted the event twice before in 1900 and 1924. The 2024 Games will mark the third time that Paris serves as the host city, making it the first city to host the Olympics three times.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        The 1924 Paris Olympics were particularly memorable, as they were the first Games to feature the iconic Olympic rings symbol and the first to include an Olympic Village for athletes. The 2024 Games will build upon this legacy, showcasing the best of Parisian culture, hospitality, and innovation.
